### Introduction
This talk is by Mr. Anthony Fung.

Data is a huge asset to the Commonwealth.  How do we turn data into value?  What are the challenges that have been encountered to get to there?  Find out what programs and initiatives the Secretary of Technology has been developing and underway to help the cause.

### Thoughts
Data means money, Big Data means a lot of money. How to bring the data into money is a difficult question because there are many questions that need to be handled, just like how to get more precise data, how to extract information from huge data, how to protect the privacy of the data, etc.

Any of these is difficult but important for the processing of Big Data. Especially privacy problem, it's important because if we cannot solve the problem, we cannot use the data in the public area to produce more value.
